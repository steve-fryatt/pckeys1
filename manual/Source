<chapter title="Introduction" file="introduction">

<cite>PC Keyboard</cite> is a small module I wrote one evening when the difference between <key>delete</key>, <key>copy</key> (<key>end</key> on a RiscPC), <key>home</key> and <key>backspace</key> on Acorns and PCs finally drove me mad.  It simply alters the actions of these keys on the Acorn so that they behave more like those on a PC.

Haven't people already done this?  Yes - but only partially.  <cite>Acorn User</cite> carried a module which used filters and so only worked where applications handled their own input and not in writeable icons.  <cite>PC Keyboard</cite> uses the InsV vector to monitor all keyboard input and so works everywhere on the Desktop. See the <link ref="Limits">Limitations</link> section below for the possible problems.

</chapter>







<chapter title="Installing PC Keyboard" file="Install">

<cite>PC Keyboard</cite> can be run off a hard disc or floppy disc.  It is RISC OS 4 compatible and has been tested on RISC OS Select.  The module is 26/32 bit neutral and should work on RISC OS 5.

To install <cite>PC Keyboard</cite> on a hard disc, copy the <file>PCKeys</file> module to a suitable place on your disc.  If you want it to run on startup, <file>PCKeys</file> should be placed in your boot sequence.  On a machine with the new boot structure installed, this can be done by copying it into the <file>Choices:Boot.Tasks</file> directory.  On older machines you will have to make your own arrangements, although you will probably have built your own boot sequence anyway.

</chapter>






<chapter title="Using PC Keyboard" file="Use">

Run the <file>PCKeys</file> module (double-click it from the desktop, or <command>*RMRun</command> it). Better still, for regular use install it somewhere where it will load every time your machine starts (such as <file>Choices:Boot.Tasks</file>).


<subhead title="Star Commands">

One * command is provided by <cite>PC Keyboard </cite>, to turn the emulation on and off.

<comdef target="*PCKeys" params="[ON|OFF]">
The <command>*PCKeys</command> command is provided to turn the emulation on and off.  It takes an optional parameter <command>ON</command> or <command>OFF</command> to toggle the state of the module.  On its own the command returns the module's current state.
</comdef>

</chapter>





<chapter title="Possible Problems" file="Limits">

<cite>PC Keyboard</cite> has one or two limitations.  The first is that not all applications support the <key>copy</key> key to delete forward.  If an application doesn't support this, the <key>delete</key> key will begin to do whatever the application made <key>copy</key> do (but <key>backspace</key> will act as <key>delete</key>).  The <key>backspace</key> key is replaced completely, so any applications looking for this will never see it (<key>ctrl-H</key>, usually returning the same code as <key>backspace</key>, is not affected).  This should not be a problem unless the application had some illicit use for <key>backspace</key>...

Finally, <key>delete</key> and <key>copy</key> change their actions when there is text selected.  A fix to stop <cite>PC Keyboard</cite> changing the key actions in this case is being considered at the moment.

</chapter>






<chapter title="Outside the Desktop" file="Outside">

Outside of the Desktop, <cite>PC Keyboard</cite> lets all keypresses through regardless of its current state.  This is because some command line applications get upset if the action of certain keys is modified.  <cite>PC Keyboard</cite> uses OS_CallEvery to check the state of the Desktop every second.
