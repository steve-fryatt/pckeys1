Introduction
------------

  PC Keyboard is a small module I wrote one evening when the difference
  between Delete, Copy (End on a RiscPC), Home and Backspace on Acorns and
  PCs finally drove me mad.  It simply alters the actions of these keys on
  the Acorn so that they behave more like those on a PC.

  Haven't people already done this? Yes - but only partially.  Acorn User
  carried a module which used filters and so only worked where applications
  handled their own input and not in writeable icons.  PC Keyboard uses the
  InsV vector to monitor all keyboard input and so works everywhere on the
  Desktop.  See the Limitations section below for the possible problems.



Installing PC Keyboard
----------------------

  PC Keyboard can be run off a hard disc or floppy disc.  It is RISC OS 4
  compatible and has been tested on RISC OS Select.  The module is 26/32 bit
  neutral and should work on RISC OS 5.

  To install PC Keyboard on a hard disc, copy the PCKeys module to a suitable
  place on your disc.  If you want it to run on startup, PCKeys should be
  placed in your boot sequence.  On a machine with the new boot structure
  installed, this can be done by copying it into the Choices:Boot.Tasks
  directory.  On older machines you will have to make your own arrangements,
  although you will probably have built your own boot sequence anyway.



Using PC Keyboard
-----------------

  Run the PCKeys module (double-click it from the desktop, or "*RMRun" it).
  Better still, for regular use install it somewhere where it will load every
  time your machine starts (such as Choices:Boot.Tasks).


  Star Commands
  -------------

  One * command is provided by PC Keyboard , to turn the emulation on and
  off.

  *PCKeys [ON|OFF]

    The "*PCKeys" command is provided to turn the emulation on and off.  It
    takes an optional parameter "ON" or "OFF" to toggle the state of the
    module.  On its own the command returns the module's current state.



Possible Problems
-----------------

  PC Keyboard has one or two limitations.  The first is that not all
  applications support the Copy key to delete forward.  If an application
  doesn't support this, the Delete key will begin to do whatever the
  application made Copy do (but Backspace will act as Delete).  The Backspace
  key is replaced completely, so any applications looking for this will never
  see it (Ctrl-H, usually returning the same code as Backspace, is not
  affected).  This should not be a problem unless the application had some
  illicit use for Backspace...

  Finally, Delete and Copy change their actions when there is text selected.
  A fix to stop PC Keyboard changing the key actions in this case is being
  considered at the moment.



Outside the Desktop
-------------------

  Outside of the Desktop, PC Keyboard lets all keypresses through regardless
  of its current state.  This is because some command line applications get
  upset if the action of certain keys is modified.  PC Keyboard uses
  OS_CallEvery to check the state of the Desktop every second.
